            <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to test that you know what the capital of each country is, and not just the names of the cities, a country must be selected before you can attempt to name its capital.</li>
                <li>Countries may be selected in any order, and once the capital has been entered correctly the country will be removed from the list so that only the remaining countries are displayed on the page.</li>
                <li class="bold">New in Version 1.1.2: If you enter the capital of a country other than the one that is currently selected, both the currently selected country and the country with the capital entered will be removed from the list and you will get 0 points!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The first country (Algeria) will be selected when you load the game. If you know the capital of Algeria, just start typing!</li>
                <li>If you enter the capital of the selected country exactly as it is registered in the program, you will automatically be awarded a point and the country will be removed from the list.</li>
                <li>If you believe you have entered the correct capital but your input has not been detected, or just want to give up and see the correct answer, use the "Reveal" option. If your input approximately matches the capital registered in the program, you will be awarded a point. Otherwise, you will forefit that country for the current play.</li>
                <li>You can change the selected country using the "Previous", "Next", or "Random" options, or by clicking directly on any country name in the list.</li>
                <li class="bold">Hint: There is no need to use your mouse! Use the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + direction keys) displayed underneath each option.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Source of Truth</h2>
            Country and capital names were taken from the Wikipedia <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents" target="_blank">List of countries by continents</a> page on 11th Jan 2021 and compiled as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Alternate spellings, translations, etc. removed to leave a single standard country/capital name.</li>
                <li>Countries without a capital city removed.</li>
                <li>In cases where more than one capital is listed, cities other than the "official capital" removed.</li>
                <li>All non-English characters replaced with their closest English equivalent (e.g. 'Ã©' changed to 'e') for ease of input.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Results history/rankings</li>
                <li>Practice game to help you remember capitals you didn't know based on your results</li>
            </ul>
