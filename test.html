        <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In order to test that you know what the capital of each country is, and not just the names of the cities,
                the country must be selected before entering the name of the capital.</li>
            <li>Countries may be selected in any order, and once a capital has been entered correctly the country will be
                removed from the list so that you can easily see which countries remain.</li>
            <li>If you use the "Reveal" option to display a country's capital, that country will be removed from the list
                and you will not be able to score a point for it in the current play.</li>
            <li>As of the current version, capital names will only be recognised if they are entered exactly as registered.
                A fuzzy match feature is planned for a future version (see "Upcoming Features" below).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first country (Algeria) will be selected when you load the game. If you know the capital of Algeria,
                just start typing!</li>
            <li>When the content of the text box matches the capital exactly as it is registered, your score will increase
                by 1, the country will be removed from the list, and the next country will automatically be selected.</li>
            <li>You can change the selected country using the "Previous", "Next", or "Random" options, or by selecting any
                country from the list</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Hint: There is no need to use your mouse! Use the Tab key to navigate forward
                through the links, Shift + Tab to navigate backwards, and Enter to select.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Key "Tab, Tab, Enter" to go to the next country.</li>
                <li>Hold the Tab key to navigate quickly through the countries. The focus will return to the input box when
                    you press Enter to select a country.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Source of Truth</h2>
        Country and capital names were taken from the Wikipedia <a
            href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents" target="_blank">List of countries by
            continents</a> page on 11th Jan 2021 and compiled as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Alternate spellings, translations, etc. removed to leave a single standard country/capital name.</li>
            <li>Countries without a capital city removed.</li>
            <li>In cases where more than one capital is listed, cities other than the "official capital" removed.</li>
            <li>All non-English characters replaced with their closest English equivalent (e.g. 'Ã©' changed to 'e') for ease
                of input.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow for alternate spellings, etc. by checking the content of the input box when a player selects "reveal".
                Award a point if the input approximately matches the answer.</li>
            <li>Implement a "results" button to link to a summary of done and remaining countries/capitals.</li>
            <li>Generate a practice page where players are tested on a random selection of 5-10 remaining capitals to train
                for their next play.</li>
            <li>Add keyboard shortcuts to enable players to navigate through countries with a single button press from input
                box.</li>
        </ul>
